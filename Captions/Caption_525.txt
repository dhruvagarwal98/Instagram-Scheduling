Umami is a Japanese word, which roughly translates to "deliciousness." It was first identified by a Japanese scientist, Kikunae Ikeda, in 1907. However, it wasn't until 2002 that umami was officially recognized as a distinct taste, in addition to sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. Umami is often described as a savory, meaty flavor, and is commonly found in foods like mushrooms, cheese, soy sauce, and tomatoes. Many young adults may find this fact intriguing, as they may not have been aware of the existence of a fifth taste.
