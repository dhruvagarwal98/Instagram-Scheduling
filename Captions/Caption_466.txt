Although the brain is almost fully developed by the age of 18, it takes until the mid-20s for the prefrontal cortex to fully mature. This area of the brain is responsible for decision-making, impulse control, and understanding consequences, which is why teenagers and young adults are more likely to take risks and engage in risky behavior. This information can help young people understand why they may sometimes make impulsive decisions and can encourage them to be more conscious of their choices.
