Although many people associate deserts with hot and dry climates, the definition of a desert is actually any area that receives very little precipitation. Because Antarctica is a polar desert, with annual precipitation of only a few centimeters, it meets this definition. In fact, the dry valleys of Antarctica are some of the driest places on Earth, with no rainfall for over 2 million years. This unique landscape is shaped by the wind and ice, and researchers have found extremophile organisms that are able to survive in this harsh environment.
