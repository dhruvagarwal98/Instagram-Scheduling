The sun, a massive ball of gas and plasma, generates an enormous amount of energy through nuclear fusion reactions at its core, which produces photons. These photons then travel through the sun's layers of gas and plasma, bouncing around and being absorbed and re-emitted by particles, before finally reaching the surface and being emitted into space as light. This process takes an incredibly long time, with some estimates suggesting that a photon can take up to 40,000 years to complete this journey. This showcases the vast distances and complexities involved in the transmission of light, as well as the intricate mechanisms of energy production within the sun.
