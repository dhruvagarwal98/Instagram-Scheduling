While avocado toast may seem like a recent fad, it actually has a long history dating back to the late 1800s in Australia. It was often served as a breakfast dish and was typically topped with lemon juice or salt. In recent years, avocado toast has become even more popular thanks to its health benefits and Instagram-worthy appearance. Avocado is high in healthy fats and fiber, making it a nutritious addition to any meal.
