Our body is capable of producing alcohol through a rare metabolic disorder known as Auto-Brewery Syndrome. This syndrome occurs when fungi or yeast convert carbohydrates into ethanol within the gut, leading to a spike in blood alcohol levels. Symptoms of this disorder include dizziness, disorientation, and even drunkenness without consuming any alcohol. This condition is extremely rare but can occur in individuals with diabetes, obesity, or following a course of antibiotics.
