A study conducted by Orb Media found that in 159 water samples taken from all over the world, including the US, UK, France, Germany, and Lebanon, 83% of tap water and 90% of bottled water were contaminated with plastic microfibers. These fibers, which originate from synthetic textiles and microbeads, are small enough to enter our bodies through drinking water, which can lead to serious health problems such as endocrine disruption and cancer. This highlights the urgent need for individuals to reduce their plastic consumption and for governments to update their policies regarding plastic pollution.
