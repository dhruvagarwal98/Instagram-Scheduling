The veil was worn by a bride named Maria Paraskeva in Cyprus in 2018 and measured 22,843 feet and 2.11 inches, which is roughly 4.3 miles long. It required a team of 20 people to carry the veil, and it took over 3 hours for the bride to walk down the aisle. The veil weighed over 44 pounds and was made of tulle and silk. This extravagant display of fashion in weddings showcases the lengths people go to make their weddings memorable and prestigious.
