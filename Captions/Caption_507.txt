The first webcam was created in 1991 by a group of computer scientists at Cambridge University. Their main purpose was to keep track of the coffee level in the break room without having to physically check it. The webcam was hooked up to a computer, which was then connected to the internet. This allowed anyone with access to the internet to check the coffee level from their own computer. The webcam was a black and white camera and the images were only updated once every three minutes.
