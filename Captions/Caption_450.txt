This amazing adaptation is a salt gland, or supraorbital gland, which is located above penguins' eyes. The gland filters excess salt from their bloodstream, collects it as a concentrated solution, and then excretes the salt through their beaks. This allows penguins to optimize their survival and limit their time spent near the ocean. Penguins inhabit some of the most inhospitable environments on earth, such as Antarctica, where freshwater is scarce, and temperatures frequently fall below zero. Hence, this unique evolutionary feature helps penguins to survive in extreme and harsh conditions.
