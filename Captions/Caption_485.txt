Exercise triggers the release of endorphins, which can improve mood and reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. A study published in JAMA Psychiatry in 2018 found that young adults who engaged in regular physical activity had a 26% lower risk of developing depression over a five-year period. Incorporating exercise into one's daily routine can have significant mental health benefits, particularly for those in the 18-24 age group who may be experiencing the stressors of transitioning into adulthood.
