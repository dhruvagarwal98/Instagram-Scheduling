Ruth Wakefield was a famous chef who owned the Toll House Inn in Massachusetts, USA. One day, while baking cookies for her guests, she realized that she was out of baker's chocolate. In a random experiment, she had some Nestle chocolate on hand and decided to break it into pieces and mix it into her cookie dough instead. She expected the chocolate to melt and create chocolate cookies, but what happened instead was that the bits held its shape, resulting in the creation of the world-famous Chocolate Chip Cookies.
