The electric eel, also known as electric catfish, is not actually an eel but a type of fish found in South America. It is unique in its ability to generate electric shocks for both hunting and self-defense, using specialized organs called electrocytes. These organs work like batteries, creating electric fields which are used to detect prey and stun or kill them. The electric eel can also use its electric shocks to navigate and communicate with other electric eels. Studies have shown that the electric eel can produce shocks up to 600 volts, making it one of the strongest bio-electric generators in the animal kingdom.
