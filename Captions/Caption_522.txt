The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31, is our nearest galactic neighbor and is 2.5 million light years away. The galaxy's trajectory means that it will collide with the Milky Way in around 4.5 billion years, resulting in a massive cosmic collision that will merge the two galaxies together. This event will significantly alter the structure of the Milky Way and Andromeda, and has the potential to create new stars and planets.
