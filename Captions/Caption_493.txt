According to the Guinness World Records, the largest snowflake ever recorded fell in Fort Keogh, Montana, USA, on January 28, 1887. The snowflake reportedly measured 15 inches wide and 8 inches thick. This record-breaking snowflake was so large that it was larger than a medium-sized pizza or the size of a standard dinner plate. Despite the potential for larger snowflakes to form, this astonishing record still stands to this day.
