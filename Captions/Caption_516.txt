The Great Lakes consist of Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario. These lakes were created by glaciers and contain approximately 84% of North America's surface freshwater and one-fifth of the world's freshwater. They are also the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world. The Great Lakes provide drinking water to more than 40 million people and are crucial to industries such as shipping, fishing, and agriculture. However, the lakes face environmental threats such as pollution, invasive species, and climate change.
