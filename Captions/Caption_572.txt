Sea sponges are some of the oldest living animals on Earth, with fossil evidence dating back over 600 million years. Additionally, they have an incredible ability to regenerate and repair themselves, which has led scientists to speculate that these creatures could hold the key to developing new therapies for human tissue regeneration. One study found that when a sponge is subjected to environmental stress such as extreme temperatures or chemical exposure, it can break down its body into individual cells which then re-aggregate and form a new sponge. Essentially, this process allows the sponge to live indefinitely as long as it is not killed by predators or disease.
