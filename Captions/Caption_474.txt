The white blood cells, or leukocytes, are an important component of the human immune system. They circulate in the blood constantly, searching for any signs of invading bacteria, viruses, or other harmful agents. When they detect a threat, they quickly multiply and attack the foreign substances, neutralizing them before they can cause serious harm to the body. In healthy individuals, the number of white blood cells ranges from 4,500 to 11,000 per microliter of blood. However, this number can vary depending on the individual's age, gender, and overall health condition.
