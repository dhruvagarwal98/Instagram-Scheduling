The spleen is an important organ that helps filter blood, fight infections, and remove abnormal or damaged cells from the body. However, some people have an additional small spleen called an accessory spleen that is usually found near the main spleen or in the area around the pancreas. Although most people with an accessory spleen don't experience any symptoms, it can sometimes cause problems such as pain, pressure, or an enlarged spleen. Accessory spleens are usually discovered through medical imaging tests or during surgery. The reason why some people have an accessory spleen is still not fully understood, but it is believed to be a remnant of embryonic development.
