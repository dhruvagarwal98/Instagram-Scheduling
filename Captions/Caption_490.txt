Despite being considered a valuable skill, multitasking actually impairs cognitive performance, particularly in tasks that require complex decision-making and problem-solving. Research conducted by Stanford University has shown that heavy multitaskers performed worse than those who preferred to focus on a single task at a time. This is because the human brain is not built to handle multiple tasks at once, which leads to decreased productivity and increased stress levels. As such, it is recommended that individuals focus on one task at a time to increase productivity and reduce stress.
