Despite stereotypes that often label gamers as young males, video games are enjoyed by people of all ages and genders. In fact, according to research conducted by Entertainment Software Association (ESA), the average age of a gamer in the United States is 35 years old. Additionally, Guinness World Records reports that a woman named Kathleen Connell was recognized as the oldest person to ever grace an eSports event at the impressive age of 90. These statistics highlight how gaming has evolved into an inclusive activity for everyone to enjoy regardless of their age.
