A team of scientists led by Evelyn Wang at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) created a device named "solar-powered harvester" that can generate water in dry climates from sunlight and air. The technology uses a metal-organic framework (MOF), a material that can absorb and trap water molecules from the air when exposed to sunlight. The MOF then releases the accumulated water when heated up again. This device is not only able to extract water from air but also does this process in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner using renewable energy. This technology's significance is because it could potentially help alleviate the global water scarcity crisis and increase accessibility to clean water.
