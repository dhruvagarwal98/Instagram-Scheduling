Scientists from the University of California have developed a contact lens prototype that can zoom in on objects up to 3x with a simple wink. The lens works by detecting the movement of the eye and triggering the zoom function. The team behind this technology believes it could be a game-changer, particularly for people with visual impairments or those working in fields such as engineering or medicine, where precision is key.
