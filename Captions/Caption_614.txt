Sea otters have incredibly thick fur, with almost a million hairs per square inch. This unique feature provides them with both buoyancy and insulation in cold ocean waters. Interestingly, their fur is not waterproof and thus requires grooming to maintain its insulating properties. Due to over-hunting for their valuable pelts, sea otters are considered endangered today.
