Contrary to popular belief, adding salt to coffee can actually enhance its flavor by reducing its bitterness. This is because sodium ions in salt suppress the bitterness in coffee without altering its taste profile. A pinch of salt can make a big difference in the taste of your morning brew. This trick is especially useful for those who do not prefer the taste of black coffee. However, adding too much salt to coffee can result in a salty taste, so it is important to use a small amount.
