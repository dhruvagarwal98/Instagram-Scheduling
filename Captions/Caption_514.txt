It may seem like a cliche to say that laughter is the best medicine, but there is actually scientific evidence to back it up. Humor has been shown to reduce stress hormones, increase immune function, and improve overall mood. People who use humor as a coping strategy are also more likely to have better relationships and social support, which can help them deal with life's challenges. So, if you want to boost your mental health and resilience, try to find the humor in everyday situations. Watch a funny movie, read a humorous book, or even just tell a joke to a friend.
