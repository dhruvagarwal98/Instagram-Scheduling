Studies have shown that individuals who get a sufficient amount of sleep and wake up early tend to have better cognitive function, improved mood, and a lower risk for chronic diseases. This is due to the fact that the circadian rhythm (the body's internal clock) is synced with the natural daylight and darkness cycle. By following a consistent sleep schedule, your body is able to optimize all of its essential functions, leading to a healthier and happier life.
