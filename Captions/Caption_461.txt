Your skin is constantly renewing itself, and this shedding is a natural part of that process. The outermost layer of your skin, the epidermis, sheds about 30,000 to 40,000 cells every hour. In a month, the average person sheds enough skin to make a complete outfit. This shedding is often invisible to the naked eye, but it can accumulate in your environment and contribute to dust and allergens.
