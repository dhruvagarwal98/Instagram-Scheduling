In 2020, scientists discovered a gigantic gas cloud composed of methanol or the simplest form of alcohol in a region of space near the center of our galaxy. It spans over 288 billion kilometers or three times the distance between Pluto and the Sun. The cloud is so vast that it could contain up to 10 billion trillion liters of alcohol, enough to make 400 trillion trillion pints of beer. The discovery provides insight into how organic molecules form and could help explain the origins of life on Earth.
