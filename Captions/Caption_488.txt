Lucy, also known as 55 Cancri e, was discovered by a team of international scientists in 2004. It is a rocky planet that is twice the size of Earth and orbits a star that is located about 40 light years from our solar system. The planet's surface temperature can reach up to 3,900 degrees Fahrenheit due to its close proximity to its sun. The high temperature is thought to cause the planet's carbon to crystallize, creating a massive diamond formation. It is estimated that Lucy's diamond core is around 5 times the size of Earth.
