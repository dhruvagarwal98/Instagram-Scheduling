Pangolins, also known as scaly anteaters, are unique creatures found in Africa and Asia. Their scales, made of keratin, the same material as human hair and nails, are used for protection against predators. Interestingly, pangolins are also the most trafficked mammal in the world, with all eight species listed as endangered or critically endangered. This is due to the belief in some parts of Asia that their scales have medicinal properties, despite no scientific evidence to support this claim.
