When you eat something spicy, your body starts to sweat, which cools you down as the sweat evaporates. The capsaicin in spicy foods can also trigger the release of endorphins, which can make you feel happier and more relaxed. This is especially useful during hot weather when you're trying to stay cool. So, next time you're feeling hot and bothered, try adding some extra spice to your meal!
