The cave chamber, named the Sarawak Chamber, is located in Gunung Mulu National Park in Malaysia and was discovered in 1981. It has a volume of 40 billion cubic feet and measures 2,300 feet in length, 1,300 feet in width, and 230 feet in height. Exploring the chamber is no easy feat as it requires a three-day journey through the jungle and a vertical climb to reach the mouth of the cave.
