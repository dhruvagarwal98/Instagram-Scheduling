The Petermann Glacier in Greenland is one of the largest glaciers on Earth, spanning over 43 miles long and 10 miles wide. In 2008, a huge chunk of ice broke off from the glacier and drifted into the ocean, creating the largest glacier calving event ever recorded. The calved ice was estimated to be around 60 stories tall and 150 feet deep, and weighed around 11 billion tons. This event highlights the significant impact of climate change on the melting of polar ice caps, and the potential consequences it can have on sea level rise.
