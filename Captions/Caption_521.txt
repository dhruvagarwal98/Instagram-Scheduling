The platypus belongs to a group of mammals called monotremes which are unique in that they lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. The absence of a stomach in the platypus is thought to be an adaptation to their diet which primarily consists of insects, larvae, and freshwater crustaceans. The stones that the platypus uses to grind up its food are contained in a structure called the gizzard and are swallowed along with their food. This process is similar to the way that birds digest their food and is an example of convergent evolution.
