According to a research conducted by Andrew Holmes in Finland, the oldest piece of chewing gum dates back to approximately 7,000 BC. This ancient chewing gum was made from bark tar and was discovered during an excavation in Kierikki, Yli-Ii. It is believed that this early form of chewing gum had medicinal benefits such as reducing tooth decay and freshening breath. Throughout history, different cultures have developed their own versions of chewing gums made from various materials including mastic tree resin (Greece), chicle (Mexico) and paraffin wax (USA).
