Sea otters are one of the few animals that are known to hold hands while sleeping, as they float in groups on their backs in the ocean. This behaviour is not just a cute quirk, but serves a practical purpose of preventing the otters from drifting away from each other, especially during rough waves. It is also seen as a way of establishing social bonds and creating a sense of community among the otters. Sea otters are an endangered species, with only an estimated 3,000 individuals left in California. Their social behaviour and unique adaptations make them an interesting and important species to protect.
