Even though we see Sirius as a single star in the sky, it is actually composed of two stars orbiting each other. The larger star, Sirius A, is twice as massive as the sun and shines 25 times brighter. The smaller star, Sirius B, is a white dwarf and is about the size of Earth but has a mass equivalent to that of the sun. This fascinating system was discovered in 1844 by Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel through his studies on Sirius' irregular movements.
