The Greenland shark, also known as the “sleeper shark,” is a slow-moving species that can grow up to 24 feet in length. Researchers have used eye lens radiocarbon dating to estimate their lifespan, and have found that they can live for up to 400 years or more. This longevity is due to their extremely slow metabolism and cold water environment. Despite their impressive age, Greenland sharks do not reach sexual maturity until they are around 150 years old.
