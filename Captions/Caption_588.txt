According to a study conducted by researchers from Oxford and Save the Elephants, elephants use vibrations in the earth to communicate with each other from miles away. This method of communication is especially useful when other methods, like vocal calls, are not effective due to factors like distance or environmental noise. The study also found that elephants are able to differentiate between different types of vibrations and can use them to convey different types of messages, including warning calls about potential danger or locating distant sources of water.
