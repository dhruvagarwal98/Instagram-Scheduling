On average, people will spend around two minutes waiting at each red light. In a recent survey conducted by Sinch, it was found that the average American driver spends around 32 hours per year sitting at red lights. When calculated over a lifetime, this amounts to roughly six months spent waiting for red lights to turn green! This just goes to show how much time we spend sitting in traffic and how important it is to be patient on the road.
